            <h2>My Technology</h2>
            <p>
                I made my own ideology from scratch and experience. 
                Its all about the times and its decision in my life.
                I made this technology because i have many things that i would like to achieve.
                The dreams that i have and the decisions made for its research are from my spirit alone.
                I really love modifying things and that made me more excited on exploring new things.
                Yes, my technology focuses more on Time and its connected attributes.
                Artificial intelligence, dreams and time drives me to focus more on purpose and life.
                I already made a few projects with some of its unique functions and i'm still researching for new things to make
                I'm not allowed to say much of it because it's confidential and it's hard to explain. 
                It's not ready to be revealed for the world to see because i will be using it for my master's and doctorate.
                The ideology that i made shaped my way of thinking and gave me back the power that i had to make things great.
<br>
<br>
                NOTE: Its a real technology that has its own purpose and NOT A COMPANY.

            <h2>My Futuristic Things </h2>
            <p>
                I develop simple programs with tons of impact to the industry.
                I highly use programming languages that are mostly made like C language.
                I am not much of a designer but i do make up for the different functions of an app through my designs.
                When it comes to programs I am highly resourceful to face the differences to achieve my goal.
                Even though there are some limitations in every learning I still train harder by coding and planning ahead.
                Life taught us to be better and stronger through challenges.
                Everything ahead of us is the future that i want to modify for the better.
                I know that my road is not easy but it is going to be more challenging than i could hope for.

            <h2>My Career</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I am a graduate of Polytechnic University of the Philippines Sto Tomas and I specialize in strategizing and coding in most fields.
                I am more of a tactical person when it comes to Information Technology and I plan on getting a doctorate in Internet of Things. 
                I use statistics and theories often to exercise my thinking and learning skills. 
                I have tons of skills in some parts of IT and those things helped me grow my confidence.
                I would like to say thanks to my teachers for teaching me.
                Although I'm not much present in some lessons the teachings still remains as an emergency strength in time of need.
                I find my failures and the lessons much comforting in times of trouble and challenge because it made me better.
                In my studies I was given tons of opportunities and a recommendation for a Master's degree in Cyber forensics in BSU by my professor.
                I'm not going to reject those things because i'll be using these for the next generation, 
                not now but in the right time with the introduction of my new technology.
